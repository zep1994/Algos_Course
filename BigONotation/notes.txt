which approach is the best? 

One solution might be good for one things and not so good at another, so there are trade offs to patterns that are chosen.

What are the patterns?

Big O Notation can help debug

what is a logrithm?
log^2(8)=3 2^3=8

log^2(value)=value 2^exponent=value

Certain searching algorithms have logorithmic time complexity 
Effectient Sorting algos 
Recursion
